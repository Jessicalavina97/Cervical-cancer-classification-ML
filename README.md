Cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer affecting women.
This is mainly due to their lifestyle choices of the individuals. The project
focuses on predicting whether the individual is likely to be diagnosed with
cervical cancer or not based on the information provided like the age, no. of
sexual partners, pregnancy, smoking status, presence of IUD and STD etc. We
can also identify the main factors responsible for cervical cancer among
women.
